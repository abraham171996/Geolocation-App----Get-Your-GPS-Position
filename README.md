Geolocation App - Get Your GPS Position

The Geolocation App is a simple React-based web application that allows users to retrieve their GPS position using the browser's geolocation API. Users can click a button to request their current location, and the app displays the latitude and longitude coordinates along with a link to OpenStreetMap, where users can view their location on the map.

Features:

Get GPS Position: Users can click the "Get my position" button to request their current GPS position using the browser's geolocation API.

Loading State: While the app is fetching the GPS position, a loading indicator is displayed to inform the user that the request is in progress.

Display GPS Position: Once the geolocation API returns the user's position, the latitude and longitude coordinates are displayed on the screen. The coordinates are presented as clickable links to OpenStreetMap, where users can view their position on the map.

Error Handling: If the geolocation request encounters an error (e.g., user denies permission or geolocation is not supported in the browser), an error message is displayed to inform the user.

Click Counter: The app keeps track of the number of times the user clicks the "Get my position" button and displays the total count.

Technologies Used:

React: The app is built using the React JavaScript library for creating user interfaces.
Geolocation API: Utilized to retrieve the user's GPS position based on their device's location.
OpenStreetMap: The app includes clickable links to OpenStreetMap to display the user's GPS position on the map.
Please note that this description provides an overview of the Geolocation App and its functionality. The app may have evolved and been updated since this description was written. For the latest version and complete codebase, please refer to the Git repository.
